# Middle Stage Jackpot

The field test creates a middle-end server containing the following components:

- [deno-oak][oak] as the main framework
- [axiod][axiod] to request data from back-end ([Budibase][budibase] cloud host in this case)
- (optional) GraphQL endpoints to handle front-end requests with [Pothos][Pothos].
